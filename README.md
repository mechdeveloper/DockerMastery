## Why Docker

Major Infrastruture Shifts

- Mainframe to PC 90'S
- Baremetal to Virtual 00'S
- Datacenter to Cloud 10'S
- Host to Contianer (Serverless)
  - Containers also include serverless, or functions as a service

- Docker is all About speed
  - speed of software deployments
  - speed of business and getting things done in a company for profit
  
  - Develop Faster
  - Build Faster
  - Test Faster
  - Deploy Faster
  - Update Faster
  - Recover Faster

The "Matrix of Hell" Breeds Complexity

- Containers Reduce Complexity

Maintenance and Complexity Drains Budgets, So Innovation Suffers
- 80% Maintenance 
- 20% Innovation

Docker is freeing up a lot of these tasks for maintenance of stuff and allowing us to get more of our time back to innovate.

## Course Resources

### Getting Course Resources (GitHub Repo)
All examples and assignment files are in a single code repository on GitHub. Each folder represents a single lecture video (but not all lectures have a folder, as not all need code). You should clone this repo into your user profile somewhere on your host. (c:/Users/username/  on Windows and /Users/username  on Mac). Having inside your user profile will ensure Docker works correctly on Mac and Windows. The location doesn't matter for Linux hosts. git clone https://github.com/BretFisher/udemy-docker-mastery.git 
If you're rather new to GitHub, you can download the GUI to make it very easy to push/pull code at https://desktop.github.com/ for Mac and Windows. A great alternative Git client is https://www.gitkraken.com/.
We won't use git much in this course but knowing the basics of pulling code, committing code, and pushing updates could be helpful at times in the course.
